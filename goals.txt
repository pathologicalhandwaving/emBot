# Goals

- Turing complete
- Full persona mined from 
  - schools attended, 
  - classes taken, 
  - friends, 
  - holidays, 
  - places I've been, 
  - personality, 
  - likes and dislikes
- Passes Loebner screening questions
- List of random responses
- List of personal id responses
- Sound dialog system which can handle random responses, topic resolution, and information flow

## High Level Architecture

- System attempts to make sense of recieved input
  - If system is about to reason out a response a reply is generated
  - If system can do the above but also has a scripted response the system will attempt to integrate the scripted response into the generated reply
